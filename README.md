# GSoC: Improvement of Uyuni Publishing Theme

**Organization**: openSUSE  
**Mentors**: Joseph Couyette and Pau Garcia.  

# Description  
Uyuni documentation is based on Antora which generates Site with a default UI features. The Project aimed at Improving the Current UI of Uyuni documentation Site and improve existing features like Admonition blocks, Tables, Adding whitespaces and other UI macros. It also involved improving User Experience by making a modern and classy UI but at the same time simple so that Users Eye easily catch information they are looking for.  

# Code
Below is the list of Add-ons and modification of UI Features:

### Admonition Blocks:
THe first feature I worked on was Adminition Blocks. Admonition blocks holds a lot of importance as they draw attention of reader to content with special label and Icon. Uyuni documentation contains mainly three kind of admonition blocks ie. **IMPORTANT, NOTE and WARNING**. I designed them to keep their identity separate from each other by giving each admonition block it's own Color and Icon.

#### Pull Request:

**Status:** Merged.  

### Tables and Pre Blocks:  
When designing Tables, Readability must hold the utmost importance. I used Zebra Stripes for designing Tables ie Using alternating different colors for each row with a header contrast so as to differentiate Header text from Column text. Pre Blockquote design was also modified to make it look clean and neat.
